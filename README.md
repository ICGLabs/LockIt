LockIt essentially locks down your PC by blocking programs that attackers can use against you. LockIt does not protect you from viruses,malware or ransomeware. Its not an alternative to antivirus, so please use at your own risk. What LockIt attempts to do is greatly reduce the attack surface by blacklisting executables attackers use that come installed by default in Windows 10. You must be Admin for LockIt to work correctly and this version is still BETA so please use at your own risk. LockIt is to only be used on Windows 10.
